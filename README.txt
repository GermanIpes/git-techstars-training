Obi-Wan Kenobi: [anguished] You were the chosen one! It was said that you would *destroy* the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
[turns away, picks up Anakin's lightsaber and looks back]
Anakin Skywalker: [shouts] I HATE YOU!
[struggles to climb up the riverbank]
Obi-Wan Kenobi: You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
[the heat from the lava ignites Darth Vader's clothes; he screams in agony as he burns]




Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage,
Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks
Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls
Of heroes into Hades' dark,
And left their bodies to rot as feasts
For dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done.
    Begin with the clash between Agamemnon--
The Greek warlord--and godlike Achilles.
