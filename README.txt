Obi-Wan Kenobi: [anguished] You were the chosen one! It was said that you would *destroy* the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
[turns away, picks up Anakin's lightsaber and looks back]
Anakin Skywalker: [shouts] I HATE YOU!
[struggles to climb up the riverbank]
Obi-Wan Kenobi: You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
[the heat from the lava ignites Darth Vader's clothes; he screams in agony as he burns]
